## ⚠️ Important Notice – Downloads in VS Code Extension

When using this extension inside **VS Code**, file downloads work differently than in a regular browser.

### Why?
VS Code Webviews **cannot access Blob URLs** (`blob:`) generated by the Web UI.  
To make downloads possible, files are **serialized to Base64** in the Webview and sent to the Extension Host, which then saves them to disk.

### ⚠️ Limitations
- Base64 encoding increases file size (~33%)
- Files are fully loaded into memory
- **Large files or large ZIPs may cause performance issues or crashes**
- This approach is recommended **only for small to medium-sized files**

### Browser vs VS Code
| Environment | Download Method |
|-----------|----------------|
| Browser | Native `<a download>` with Blob URLs |
| VS Code Extension | Base64 → Extension Host → `fs.writeFile` |

### Recommendation
For large files or intensive transfers, prefer using the **web version** of the application.

This behavior is a technical limitation of the VS Code Webview environment, not a bug in the extension.
