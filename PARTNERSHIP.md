(OFFICIAL "client")

<br>

Partner up by creating an [Issue](https://github.com/erikraft/Drop/issues) in this repository so I can review and decide whether to accept the partnership to have a PARTNER ("client").

## Logo Submission Requirements

- A photo of the logo is mandatory.
- Accepted formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and similar.
- Preferred format: `.svg`.
- If the logo is submitted in `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or similar formats, it will be converted to `.svg`.
- Submit the logo in an all-white version.
- We strongly recommend providing the `.svg` version.
